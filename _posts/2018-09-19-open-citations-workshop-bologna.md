The Open Citations Workshop took place in Bologna from the 3rd to the  5th of September. Together with 60 other researchers, publishers and funders, Astrid Orth and Steffen Lemke from the \*metrics project discussed Open Access to bibliographic citations, appropriate policy frameworks, experiences with open bibliographic citations, and relevant projects on citations and other metrics.

It was a very successful workshop with many exciting presentations and a very good organization. The \*metrics team presented its work with a [poster]({{sitebase.url}}/downloads/metrics_poster_download.pdf) and discussed with the participants the question "How do citation-based and alternative metrics benefit each other?
