ON-MERRIT is pleased to announce its brand new series of virtual appointments! 

They aim at presenting the project objectives and results on the one hand and to explore several issues related to Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) and Open Science together with experts in those fields. 

The burning issues tackled in the first batch of conversations span from research assessment and ways for RRI to make a change in career progression and equal evaluation to Open Science as a driver to the change in research practices, from the difficulties in gender equality in research and academia to open science in the Global South.

Hereâ€™s the summary of the webinars and the topics that will be discussed.

| 09 June 2021 | **Open Science as a driver to change?**  
Open research is definitely amongst the hot topics of the moment: the COVID19 pandemic has brought an exceptional sharing of research data and an even more exceptional uptake of preprints publishing. But is this methodological revolution here to stay? What is holding us back from making Open Science simply the default way of doing Science? And is Open Science responsible science by default? In this ON-MERRIT webinar, Paola will illustrate the principles and motivation behind a full transition to open research practices, and I will make the case that the uptake of these practices needs to be a slow, responsible process, based on education and training of core and much-needed skills. Paola will also dedicate some time to the invisible side of open science, the one that can lead to the construction of more inclusive, fair, and just academic spaces.
