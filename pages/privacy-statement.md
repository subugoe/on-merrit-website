## Purposes and legal bases of the processing

Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis. In the processing of personal data required for the fulfilment of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. Insofar as the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis. In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis. Your data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. e GDPR in order to process your request and at the same time to enable us to perform our tasks which are in the public interest. If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our institution or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing. This is always the case when you contact us via the e-mail address provided. In the event of contact by e-mail, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in the processing of the data.

## Recipient of personal data

In order to answer your inquiry, your personal data will be transmitted to the persons responsible within the SUB Göttingen.

## Transfer of personal data to third parties or to a third country

Should it be necessary for personal data to be transferred to third parties, you will be expressly informed of this. It is not planned to actively transfer your personal data to a third country. Please note the possibility of transferring personal data to a third country if you use one of the plug-ins described below (Twitter, Disqus).

## Duration of storage of personal data

Your data will be stored in order to provide the services you request. As soon as you unsubscribe or ask for the data to be deleted, your data will only be stored until all current processes have been completed and then deleted, unless legal requirements require longer storage. The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. For the personal data sent by e-mail, this is the case when the conversation with the user is finished. The conversation is terminated when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the facts in question have been finally clarified.

## Rights of the persons affected

According to the EU Data Protection Regulation you have the following rights: If your personal data are processed, you have the right to obtain information about the data stored about your person (Art. 15 GDPR). Should incorrect personal data be processed, you have a right to correction (Art. 16 GDPR). If the legal requirements are met, you may request the deletion or restriction of the processing and file an objection against the processing (Art. 17, 18 and 21 GDPR). If you do not provide the required information, your request can not be processed. If you have consented to data processing or a contract for data processing exists and data processing is carried out using automated procedures, you may have a right to data transferability (Art. 20 GDPR). Should you make use of your above rights, Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen will check whether the legal requirements have been met.

To exercise your rights, please contact the company data protection officer. In case of complaints regarding data protection law, you can contact the responsible supervisory authority:

## Right of revocation in case of consent

If you have consented to processing by the Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen by means of an appropriate declaration, you can revoke your consent at any time for the future. The legality of data processing based on the consent until revocation is not affected by this.


## Statistical data for the operator of the website

This website uses the open source software Matomo for the statistical evaluation of visitor access. Matomo is configured in compliance with data protection regulations, data is stored anonymously. The "session cookies" used for this purpose are text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is stored on the GWDG server. The IP address is made anonymous immediately after processing and before it is stored. The data collected by Matomo will be used in anonymous form to improve our services. IP addresses are stored in Matomo without the last tuple. We know from which network a request came, but not from which computer. These "session cookies" do not contain any personal data and expire at the end of the session. Techniques such as Java applets or Active-X controls, which make it possible to trace the access behavior of users, are not used. In detail, the following data is stored about each access/retrieval: the first two parts of the IP address, date and time, user agent of the software used, accessed page/name of the retrieved file, transferred data volume, message whether the access/retrieval was successful.

**The legal basis** for processing users' personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

**Purpose of data processing:** The processing of users' personal data enables us to analyse the surfing behaviour of our users. We are able to compile information about the use of the individual components of our website by evaluating the data obtained. This helps us to continuously improve our website and its user-friendliness. For these purposes, it is also in our legitimate interest to process the data in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. By anonymizing the IP address, users' interest in protecting their personal data is sufficiently taken into account.

By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Matomo in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
