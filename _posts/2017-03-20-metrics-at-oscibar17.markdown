ZBW organised this year's Open Science Barcamp on 20 March 2017. Almost 100 open science enthusiasts assembled at Wikimedia's offices in Berlin. In lively discussions we dealt with topics like MOOCs, Open Educational Ressources, Open Science practices and Alternative/Open Metrics (session list can be found in the [master etherpad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/barcamp_open_science_2017).  

\*metrics project manager Astrid Orth held a session on Open Metrics which covered the following topics and ideas: :  
  * Should open metrics complement or substitute traditional metrics and how?  
  * Calculating more statistics is probably not the solution, transparency on the meaning and interpretation of those statistics is needed.  
  * New metrics have a number of advantages over traditional, citation based statistics.  
  * Awareness-raising among researchers will also help in adopting open metrics.  

The whole discussion can be found in the [session pad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/oscibar2017_session6).
Expect some answers on this over the next 2 years from the \*metrics project.
