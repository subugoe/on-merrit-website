Scientific knowledge is a key resource for achieving societal and economic goals. Open Science (OS) and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) promise to fundamentally transform scholarship to bring greater transparency, inclusivity and participation to research processes, and increase the academic, economic and societal impact of research outputs. These form a cross-cutting agenda that stands to contribute to most of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and are a central pillar of the European Commission’s Digital Single Market strategy. Yet access to scientific products and processes is not made uniform simply because they are made available via the Internet. How equitable is the implementation of OS and RRI across a range of stakeholder categories, and in particular for those at the peripheries? Might RRI interventions, in some cases, actually deepen socioeconomic inequalities (the digital divide) and be in conflict with wider sustainable development goals? How do geographical, socio-economic, cultural and structural conditions lead to peripheral configurations in the European knowledge landscape? What factors are at play and what can be done (at a policy level) to foster absorptive capacity and enhance OS/RRI uptake and contributions to scientific production across regions?

Such questions lie at the heart of ON-MERRIT. The work conducted in ON-MERRIT’s work package 3 “Research cultures, support and incentives” (WP3) provides rich evidence to answer these and further questions. WP3 included several tasks which aimed to study how the application of RRI and Open Science policies, principles and practices affect research, researchers and their careers across diverse contexts. In this blog post we share the results of our research activities and describe how they relate to the project’s wider aims.

##Datasets on Open Science and RRI 

Our first task was to gather multiple sets and sources of data, which could then be analysed and shared with the research community. We focused on two specific approaches:

1. A dataset on Promotion, Review and Tenure policies (PRT-policies) from institutions in seven countries (Austria, Brazil, Germany, India, Portugal, United Kingdom and the United States). The respective policies were collected by the study team and subsequently coded for a range of traditional (such as the length of one’s CV or metrics related to the journals one has published in) and non-traditional indicators (such as the rate of Open Access (OA) publishing, the sharing of research data and code, engagement with the public and citizen science). The full analysis was undertaken in ON-MERRIT WP6, and recently made available in our report D6.1 Investigating Institutional Structures of Reward & Recognition in Open Science & RRI.
A corpus of scholarly research outputs processed from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and CORE, a large aggregator of Open Access (OA) content.

2. A full description of the methodology involved in collecting these datasets is available in Deliverable Report D3.1 “RRI and Open Science Datasets” on Zenodo. We also intend to publish the data itself via a data publication in the near future.
