Today, ON-MERRIT took part in the [RefResh 2020 workshop](http://refresh20.infrascience.isti.cnr.it/) presenting the projectâ€™s main research topic, the [Matthew Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) in Open Science and [Responsible Research and Innovation](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/responsible-research-innovation). 

The workshop aimed at bringing together researchers, practitioners and policy-makers to reframe research, based on interdisciplinary analysis that considers research as a complex system that influences and is influenced by society, economics, culture, and politics. 

ON-MERRIT was able to showcase the first tangible results of the project so far, from the [Open Science Datasets](https://zenodo.org/record/3874587) to the investigation of the uptake of [Open Science resources](https://zenodo.org/record/3875018) in the industry to the role of [open science outputs in policymaking](https://zenodo.org/record/3875055).
