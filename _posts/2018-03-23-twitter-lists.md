Twitter is an exciting platform for exchanging information with people from all over the world on specific topics. For scientists, too, the importance of Twitter in their daily work is increasing - this shows a survey we conducted as part of our project. That's why we've created public twitter lists regarding alternative metrics and Open Access on Twitter. Interested Twitter users can subscribe to these lists - divided into persons and institutions - and become aware of new colleagues and organisations. The lists are always updated - we look forward to receiving information on who should be included in the lists via Twitter: [@metrics_project](www.twitter.com/metrics_project).
