## Results
For our survey, we received responses from 167 active researchers, with a slight skew towards more senior, male academics from Europe, working in the fields of Social Sciences, Engineering and Technology and the Natural sciences. Concepts of OS/RRI, such as Open Access publishing, Research Data Management, Reproducible Research, and Citizen Science, are looked upon favourably, as a different way to do research, although some reluctance and doubts were present on how to put them into practice. Research Integrity and Gender are the topics that gathered more consensus and are best implemented.

Interestingly, we found that the majority of our survey participants had not received training in any of the above OS/RRI topics (very often a large majority). The most popular topics for those who had received training were OA publishing, Research Integrity, Gender, Open Data and OS in general.
