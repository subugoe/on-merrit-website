ON-MERRIT is pleased to announce its brand new series of virtual appointments! 

They aim at presenting the project objectives and results on the one hand and to explore several issues related to Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) and Open Science together with experts in those fields. 

The burning issues tackled in the first batch of conversations span from research assessment and ways for RRI to make a change in career progression and equal evaluation to Open Science as a driver to the change in research practices, from the difficulties in gender equality in research and academia to open science in the Global South.

Hereâ€™s the summary of the webinars and the topics that will be discussed.
