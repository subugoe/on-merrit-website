As part of the [STI Conference 2018](http://sti2018.cwts.nl), *metrics team members Isabella Peters and Katrin Weller will be organizing a special track on the topic “Challenges of Social Media Data for Bibliometrics”. 
  
This specialized track focuses on the ongoing challenges for using data from social media platforms and from third party aggregators as sources for research metrics and scientometric indicators. These challenges include but are not limited to:  
   
- platform-based restrictions in accessing social media data and potential biases resulting from limited access (also: biases introduced by data aggregators)  
- black boxes, hidden algorithms, and lack of information about collection processes and context affecting the use of social media data and data aggregators  
- lack of understanding of user activities (e.g. motivations to retweet, like, share) and user groups in academic contexts  
- incomplete data (e.g. due to missing DOIs or identifiers not tracked by aggregators) and noise (e.g.due to bot-activity)  
  
**Submissions are open**  
We invite submissions of original research studying the quality of social media data and data aggregators for measuring scholarly communication as well as short (hands-on) introductions and best practices for using data from one or more specific social media platforms or aggregators.
[Please submit your work as short papers (max 3,000 words) until April 13, 2018.](http://sti2018.cwts.nl/submissions )
