ON-MERRIT has launched a survey directed at SMEs and the industry to understand the usage of freely available scientific resources.

With this survey, we would like to find out whether and to what extent small and medium-sized enterprises and industry use or do not use freely available scientific resources (= Open Science Resources) such as data, information and publications.
We invite employees of all levels working in SMEs and industry in the domains of health, climate and agriculture to take part in the survey.

We kindly ask you to spend 20 minutes - each completed survey counts!

The survey is available in (https://survey.know-center.tugraz.at/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=311541&lang=en)[English] and (https://survey.know-center.tugraz.at/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=311541&lang=de)[German]; please pick the language you prefer and spread the news in your networks!
