From March 26 to 28 the project partners came together at ZBW Kiel (Leibniz information center) to talk about the progress made in the different project areas. Special topics were the upcoming [*metrics-workshop](https://metrics-project.net/en/events/workshop2018/) and the second survey conducted by [Steffen Lemke](https://metrics-project.net/en/uber_uns/team/) and [Maryam Mehrazar](https://metrics-project.net/en/uber_uns/team/). 
We thank the ZBW project members for the informative and pleasant stay in Kiel!
