The main objective of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of \*metrics, especially in terms of their general significance and their perception amongst stakeholders. To this end, key considerations will include the quality of \*metrics underlying data (in terms of validity and reliability), the historical context within which \*metrics arose, as well as their ability to adequately assess scientific outputs against the background of disciplinary specificities. The project's findings will benefit \*metrics users (e.g., researchers, research funders), information services and libraries, as well as \*metrics providers, enabling \*metrics informed use and widening our kowledge about their limitations and possibilities for interpretation. A publicly-funded project such as \*metrics also guarantees transparency and open access to project results, which is not the norm among commercial providers in this area.

The methodological work will be supported by a scientific committee and accompanied by community building and public relations activities, the creation of new links with national and international initiatives (e.g. [COAR](https://www.coar-repositories.org/), [NISO](http://www.niso.org/home/)) and the establishment of a \*metrics
information platform.
