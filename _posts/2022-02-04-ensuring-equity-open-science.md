**Are you interested in how Open Science and Responsible Research and Innovation can contribute to a more equitable scientific environment?**

Then join ON-MERRIT’s final event on ensuring equity in Open Science! 

ON-MERRIT is an EC-funded project investigating issues of equity in the transition to Open Science and RRI. As we reach our closing stages, we are pleased to invite you to join our final project event. Here,  we will showcase ON-MERRIT’s research results and recommendations to institutions, researchers, funders and policymakers on mitigating key threats to equity in Open Science and RRI.
Renowned speakers Sarah de Rijcke and Leslie Chan will also contribute their perspectives on these issues with insightful keynotes on reform of rewards and recognition and equity in Open Science respectively.

Attendees will gain an understanding of the current status of the implementation of Open Science and RRI policies at all levels, learn about the challenges in fostering their adoption, and have the chance to discuss the practical recommendations proposed by the project. Everyone, including researchers, funders, research institutions and policymakers and beyond are invited to atten

Co-chair [Research on Research Institute (RoRI)](http://researchonresearch.org), founded by Wellcome Trust, University of Sheffield, Leiden University, and Digital Science.

Sarah specialises in social studies of research evaluation, and has published widely on the topic of the relations between quality control mechanisms and knowledge production in different fields. She has also developed a strong international public academic presence with outreach activities in science policy, speaking frequently on the topic of research evaluation and metrics uses.



**Leslie Chan** is Associate Professor in the Department of Global Development Studies and the director of the Knowledge Equity Lab at the University of Toronto Scarborough. An early practitioner of the Web for scholarly exchange and online learning, Leslie is interested in the role and design of knowledge infrastructure and their impact on local and international development. In particular, he has been studying the geopolitics of academic knowledge production and the uneven power relations embedded in this production. Leslie was the PI of the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDNet). He is on the advisory board of several international organizations, including the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and the steering committee of Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI).
