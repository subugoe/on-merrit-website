Although the webinar didn't take place as scheduled, Lizzie Gadd, the speaker of our webinar on Bibliometrics, the "Matthew Effect and diversity in academia" recorded a video with her presentation.

The content explores what academia rewards and the consequences of this, before looking at what academia actually values about research and researchers, and why this is often difficult to measure. It then considers whether falling back on bibliometrics to evaluate research is always a bad thing before drawing some conclusions.
