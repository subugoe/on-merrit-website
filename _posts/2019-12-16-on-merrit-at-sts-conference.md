Due to the current situation with the global Coronavirus pandemic and the official regulations passed by the Austrian Government we regret to inform you that the conference, which was planned to be held from May 4th to 6th, 2020, has been postponed. 

 
We are pleased to announce that two of our colleagues in ON-MERRIT, [Stefan Reichmann and Bernhard Wieser]({{ site.url }}/uber_uns/team/), are co-organizing next year’s [Science, Technology, Society conference (STS)](https://www.tugraz.at/arbeitsgruppen/sts/sts-conference-graz/) which will take place in Graz, Austria, 4-6 May 2020.    
The conference is organized annually by the Science, Technology, Society Unit at Graz University of Technology.   

In total, the conference features 8 session tracks, with topics ranging from Digitization of Society to Mobility to Energy Systems. We are especially pleased to announce that the upcoming conference also features an extensive [Open Science track](https://sts-conference.isds.tugraz.at/event/10/page/157-overview-session-tracks), including 8 sessions on various issues related, but not limited to, Open Science. Please use [this link](https://sts-conference.isds.tugraz.at/event/10/page/157-overview-session-tracks) to submit your abstract!   

We are especially happy to announce that Stefan Reichmann and Bernhard Wieser will host a session in close proximity to key issues in ON-MERRIT entitled [“Open Science: Closing the gap between scientific expertise and policy-making?”](https://sts-conference.isds.tugraz.at/event/10/page/163-a-open-science-rethinking-the-science-and-society-relationship). The session attempts to gauge the links between two discussion strands: Open Science, understood broadly as a bunch of practices such as Open Access, Data Sharing, or Open Peer Review, and the Evidence-Policy Gap, familiar e.g. from Public Health literature. Since Open Science holds the promise to enhance science and society relationships by making scientific endeavours more transparent for audiences beyond the ivory towers of universities and research institutions, Open Science practices might help to amend the Evidence-Policy Gap. The session therefore aims to engage, but is not limited to, researchers and Open Science practitioners who take part in or inform evidence-based policy-making. Panellists should reflect on participatory processes in policy making or possible barriers to and incentives for participation with the aim of understanding whether and how Open Science can help to close the evidence-policy gap.      

We cordially invite contributions from within and beyond the ON-MERRIT consortium on Open Science Governance, Open Science and Policy-Making, Democratization of research, and 5 more topics. The aim of the session track is to start (and continue) conversations between researchers from the fields of Open Science (and RRI) and STS scholars.
