On May 18, 2021 ON-MERRIT kicked off the series of webinars with the first one titled "Matthew Effects in Science", with Tony Ross-Hellauer (KNOW Center), Bernhard Wieser and Stefan Reichmann (TU Graz).

The webinar introduced participants to Robert Merton’s notion of the Matthew effect in academia and his later work on cumulative advantage (disadvantage). Against this backdrop of a close reading of Merton’s analysis, the webinar drew links to the recent reception of these two concepts in the Open Science discourse. The webinar is related to research activities in ON-MERRIT, an EC-funded project to investigate how and if open and responsible research practices could mitigate or worsen existing inequalities in academia.
