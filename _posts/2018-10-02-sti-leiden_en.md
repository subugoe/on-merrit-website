The 23rd International Conference on Science, Technology and Innovation [(STI)](http://sti2018.cwts.nl/) took place in Leiden, The Netherlands in 2018. From the 12th to the 14th of September it focused mainly on the transformation of indicators. Beyond that, the program covered a wide range of topics, from reproducibility in scientometrics and discussion of the RRI concept to Open Scholarship.<br/>
These topics were structured in 12 tracks, of which Track 11 was hosted by the \*metrics team.

[Astrid Orth](https://metrics-project.net/de/uber_uns/team/), [Isabella Peters](https://metrics-project.net/de/uber_uns/team/) and [Katrin Weller](https://metrics-project.net/de/uber_uns/team/) talked with the participants of the 11th track about the challenges of social media data for bibliometrics: algorithms, APIs, aggregators.

<br/>
One of the striking results:<br/>
Articles get more attention in social media if the last mentioned author is unfamiliar.<br/>
