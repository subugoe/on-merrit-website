**Are you interested in how Open Science and Responsible Research and Innovation can contribute to a more equitable scientific environment?**

Then join ON-MERRIT’s final event on ensuring equity in Open Science! 

During this event **on March 22, 2022**, we will showcase ON-MERRIT’s research results and recommendations to institutions, researchers, funders and policymakers.
Renowned keynote speakers will frame the conversation around rewards, incentives and recognition of Open Science practices in academia, and suggest ideas for the way forward.

Attendees will gain an understanding of the current status of the implementation of OS and RRI policies at all levels, learn about the challenges in fostering their adoption, and have the chance to discuss the practical recommendations proposed by the project. Researchers, funders, research institutions and policymakers from across Europe and beyond are invited to attend.

Check the schedule and sign up! Participation in the conference is free, upon registration; **[please register here](https://uni-goettingen.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMvceiprDMoHdIOujE7WXdH1ow0XJqtsQqW)**.
