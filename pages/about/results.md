## \*Metrician - An Altmetrics Generator
With the \*Metrician, the \*metrics team has created its own tool to collect and aggregate altmetrics for documents. In contrast to the tools of commercial providers, the \*Metrician makes it possible to track what is counted and how, thanks to it being available as open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbv/metrics-crawler). 

Using a DOI, the \*Metrician can display altmetrics to give an insight into the use of a resource. The focus is on alternative metrics from social media such as Twitter, Youtube and Facebook.

The tool is ready to be tested with DOIs for documents from the GoeScholar, SSOAR and EconStor repositories.
If there is no interest in specific metrics DOIs can be generated for testing purposes.
